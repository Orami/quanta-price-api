# QUANTA Project Security Overview

**🔒 Security Status**: Documented & Improved
**Last Updated**: October 18, 2025

---

## 📋 Quick Security Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Security audit conducted
- [x] .env.example created (no real secrets)
- [x] Oracle V2 created with enhanced security
- [x] All vulnerabilities documented
- [x] .gitignore protecting .env file
- [x] Security best practices documented

### ⏳ Action Required
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Rotate private key (see SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Rotate API keys
- [ ] Deploy Oracle V2 when ready
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting
- [ ] Add HTTPS for production deployment

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: First-Time Setup

If you're setting up this project for the first time:

1. **Never use the example keys in .env.example**
2. **Generate your own keys**:
   ```bash
   # Generate new wallet
   cast wallet new

   # Get API keys:
   # - Moralis: https://admin.moralis.io
   # - BaseScan: https://basescan.org/myapikey
   ```

3. **Copy .env.example to .env and fill in YOUR keys**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Add your real keys
   ```

4. **NEVER commit .env to git** (already in .gitignore)

## 📄 Security Documentation

This project includes comprehensive security documentation:

1. **SECURITY_AUDIT.md** - Full security audit with:
   - Critical vulnerabilities
   - Risk assessment
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Action plan

2. **contracts/QuantaPriceOracleV2.sol** - Enhanced oracle with:
   - Ownership transfer (2-step)
   - Emergency pause mechanism
   - Pool removal functions
   - Explicit validation checks
   - Try-catch for failed pools

3. **.env.example** - Safe template (no real keys)

## 🔐 Security Features

### Smart Contract (V2)
- ✅ Ownership transfer (2-step for safety)
- ✅ Emergency pause/unpause
- ✅ Remove pool functions
- ✅ Explicit reserve validation
- ✅ Try-catch for pool failures
- ✅ Event logging for all operations

### API
- ✅ CORS enabled
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Request caching (30s)
- ⏳ Rate limiting (TODO)
- ⏳ HTTPS enforcement (prod only)

### Development
- ✅ .env protected by .gitignore
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Solidity 0.8.20 (overflow protection)
- ✅ No secrets in git history

## ⚠️ Known Issues

See SECURITY_AUDIT.md for full details:

1. **Private keys in .env** - Rotate immediately
2. **API keys in .env** - Rotate immediately
3. **No rate limiting** - Add before production
4. **No HTTPS** - Required for production
5. **npm vulnerabilities** - Low risk, dev dependencies only

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices

### For Developers:

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Always check .env is in .gitignore
   - Use .env.example for templates
   - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed

2. **Use Oracle V2 for new deployments**
   - Enhanced security features
   - Better error handling
   - Ownership transfer capability

3. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Monitor Dependabot alerts
   - Run `npm audit` regularly
   - Update when patches available

### For Production:

1. **Environment**:
   - Use secret management (AWS Secrets, etc.)
   - Different wallets for dev/prod
   - Enable MFA on all accounts

2. **API**:
   - Enable HTTPS only
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add helmet.js
   - Sanitize error messages

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Use multi-sig for ownership
   - Monitor for anomalies
   - Have emergency procedures
   - Keep backups of ABIs

## 🔄 Migrating from V1 to V2 Oracle

When ready to upgrade:

1. **Deploy V2**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deployV2.ts --network base
   npx hardhat verify --network base <V2_ADDRESS>
   ```

2. **Add pools to V2**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/setupAllPools.ts --network base
   ```

3. **Update .env**:
   ```
   ORACLE_CONTRACT=<V2_ADDRESS>
   ```

4. **Test thoroughly** before updating API to use V2

**For Security Issues**:
- Review SECURITY_AUDIT.md first
- Check .env is never committed
- Rotate keys immediately if exposed
- Follow incident response plan
